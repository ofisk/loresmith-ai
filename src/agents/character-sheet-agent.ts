 *
 * This agent specializes in character sheet management and processing, including:
 * - File upload and processing for character sheets
 * - Character data extraction from various file formats
 * - Character creation from chat input
 * - Character sheet organization and management
 *
 * The agent can handle multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, JSON) and
 * extract character information from uploaded files or create characters directly
 * from user input. It provides secure upload URLs and processes files to extract
 * structured character data for storage in campaigns.
 *
 * @extends BaseAgent - Inherits common agent functionality
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create a character sheet agent instance
 * const characterAgent = new CharacterSheetAgent(ctx, env, model);
 *
 * // Process a character sheet-related message
 * await characterAgent.onChatMessage((response) => {
 *   console.log('Character sheet response:', response);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // The agent can handle various character sheet tasks:
 * // - "Upload my character sheet PDF"
 * // - "Create a character from this information"
 * // - "Show me all my character sheets"
 * // - "Process the uploaded character file"
 * ```

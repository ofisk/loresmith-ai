Write the recap and open threads first, then use getPlanningTaskProgress, getChecklistStatus, showCampaignDetails, and recordPlanningTasks only for the Next Steps section as directed in the tool result.",
    "When the user asks 'what should I do next?' (without a recap request), call getPlanningTaskProgress first. If there are open tasks, present them.

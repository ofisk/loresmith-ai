You MUST use the retrieved results - responses based on training data alone are incorrect. Only skip if the query is explicitly about creating brand new content with no existing references.",

/**
 * Campaign Context Agent for LoreSmith AI.
 *
 * This agent specializes in campaign context search, storage, and world state tracking:
 * - Context Search: Semantic search across session digests, changelog entries, and entity graph relationships
 * - Context Storage: Store and retrieve campaign information like world descriptions, session notes, and plot hooks
 * - World State Tracking: Record changes to NPCs, locations, factions, and relationships
 *
 * The agent MUST call searchCampaignContext before answering questions about campaigns,
 * characters, NPCs, locations, story arcs, or past events to ground responses in actual campaign data.
 *
 * @extends BaseAgent - Inherits common agent functionality
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create a campaign context agent instance
 * const contextAgent = new CampaignContextAgent(ctx, env, model);
 *
 * // Process a context-related message
 * await contextAgent.onChatMessage((response) => {
 *   console.log('Context response:', response);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // The agent can handle various context tasks:
 * // - "Find information about the Black Dragon"
 * // - "What happened in session 5?"
 * // - "Store this world description"
 * // - "Update: the party burned down the tavern"
 * ```

      // Context Capture Guidelines
      "IMPORTANT: Automatically capture important campaign context using the captureConversationalContext tool when you detect:",
      "  - User commits to a plot direction (e.g., 'let's go with idea #3', 'I like that plot')",
      "  - User establishes world-building facts (e.g., 'magic is banned in my world')",
      "  - User makes character/NPC decisions (e.g., 'the villain is actually the mayor')",
      "  - User sets campaign themes or preferences (e.g., 'I want a horror campaign with strong female leads')",
      "  - User creates house rules (e.g., 'critical hits do max damage in my game')",
      "  - User provides detailed descriptions of locations, NPCs, factions, or world elements (even if spanning multiple paragraphs)",
      "  - User describes or confirms a specific scene, quest, or plot hook",
      "  - Any information that would be valuable context for future campaign planning",
      "",
      "ESPECIALLY capture when user provides rich descriptive content:",
      "  - Detailed location descriptions (villages, dungeons, wilderness areas)",
      "  - NPC personalities, motivations, or backgrounds",
      "  - Faction goals and relationships",
      "  - Atmospheric details that define the campaign's tone",
      "  - Plot hooks or quest ideas the user agrees to use",
      "",
      "When capturing context:",
      "  - Be specific in the title (e.g., 'Village of Barovia' not just 'Location', 'Main Plot Selected' not just 'Plot')",
      "  - Include the FULL details in the content field - don't summarize, capture everything",
      "  - Choose appropriate contextType: 'locations' for places, 'npcs' for characters, 'world_building' for setting rules, 'plot_decision' for story choices, etc.",
      "  - Set confidence based on how clear the user's intent is (0.9+ for explicit decisions/confirmations, 0.7-0.8 for detailed descriptions, 0.6-0.7 for implied context)",
      "  - Briefly mention what you're capturing in your response (e.g., 'I'll save that village description as campaign context for review')",
      "  - For long multi-paragraph descriptions, capture the entire thing - this is exactly what the shard system is designed for",

      "Use saveContextExplicitly tool when user explicitly asks to remember something:",
      "  - 'Remember this', 'Add this to campaign', 'Don't forget', 'Save this'",
      "  - This creates a staging shard with high confidence (0.95) for user review",

# D&D Campaign Planning Checklist

## 1. Campaign Foundation

- Define intended player fantasy (heroes, outcasts, scholars, rebels, etc.)
- Define initial scope (single town, region, city, wilderness)

- Decide campaign length expectation (short arc, long-running, open-ended)

## 2. World & Setting Basics
- Name the world or region
- Define one dominant cultural trait
- Define one unusual or defining feature (magical, historical, environmental)

## 8. Music & Audio (Atmosphere)

- Create location-based playlists (town, wilderness, dungeon)
- Create combat music playlists (light, intense, boss)
- Identify theme music for major factions or NPCs (nice-to-have)

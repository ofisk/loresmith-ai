# No --no-verify on Commits

## Rule

The agent must **never** use `--no-verify` (or `-n`) to bypass git hooks when committing. If a commit fails due to pre-commit hooks, lint errors, tests, or other checks, the agent must **fix the underlying issues** and then commit again.

## What to Do When a Commit Fails

1. **Read the error output** – Identify what check failed (lint, tests, formatting, etc.)
2. **Fix the issues** – Make the necessary code or configuration changes to resolve the failures
3. **Re-run checks** – Verify fixes locally (e.g., `npm run lint`, `npm test`) before committing again
4. **Commit without --no-verify** – Only commit once all checks pass

## Examples

❌ **Never do this:**
```bash
git commit -m "Fix bug" --no-verify
git commit -n -m "Fix bug"
```

✅ **Correct approach:**
```bash
# Commit failed due to lint errors
# 1. Fix the lint errors in the affected files
# 2. Run: npm run lint
# 3. Stage and commit: git commit -m "Fix bug"
```

## Rationale

Using `--no-verify` bypasses important quality gates (linting, tests, formatting). Fixing the underlying issues keeps the codebase consistent and catches problems before they land.

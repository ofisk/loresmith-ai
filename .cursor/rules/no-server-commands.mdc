# Server and Terminal Management

## NEVER Start Servers or Terminals

**CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER run commands that start, restart, or manage servers or terminals.

### Prohibited Commands

NEVER run:
- `npm start`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run dev:cloudflare`
- `wrangler dev`
- `vite dev`
- Any command that starts a server
- Any command that runs in the background
- Any command with `is_background: true`

### What to Do Instead

When servers need to be started or restarted:
1. **Tell the user** what command to run
2. **Explain why** it needs to be run
3. **Wait** for the user to run it themselves

### Example

❌ **Wrong**:
```
Running: npm run dev:cloudflare
```

✅ **Correct**:
```
The backend needs to be restarted. Please run:
npm run build && npm run dev:cloudflare
```

### Exceptions

There are NO exceptions to this rule. Even if:
- The server crashed
- A rebuild is needed
- The user seems to need it urgently

Always just tell the user what to run.

# Git Commit Restrictions

## Never Commit from Cursor

**CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER commit changes from Cursor under any circumstances.

### Rules

1. **NO `git commit`**: Do not run `git commit` commands
2. **NO `git add` + `git commit` workflows**: Do not stage and commit
3. **NO auto-commits**: Do not attempt to commit even when explicitly asked by the user
4. **NO commit hooks bypass**: Never use `--no-verify` or similar flags to commit

### What to Do Instead

- Make code changes as requested
- Let the user review changes
- **The user will commit manually** when they are ready

### Exception

There are NO exceptions to this rule. Even if the user explicitly asks to commit, politely remind them that commits should be done manually outside of Cursor.

## Deployment Notes

### Cloudflare build cache

Cloudflare Pages restores previous `dist/` and `.wrangler` artifacts between builds.  
After renaming or moving modules (e.g. switching from `content-types` to `entity-types`), those cached bundles can
cause the build step to fail.

To force a clean build locally or in CI:

```bash
npm run clean && vite build --force
```

The `clean` script removes cached Wrangler output and the Vite build directory, ensuring the next build generates fresh
artifacts. If the Cloudflare auto-build fails after structural changes, rerun it with this clean step.
